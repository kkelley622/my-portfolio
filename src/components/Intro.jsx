    <div>My name is Kevin Kelley. I'm a full stack software engineer with a majority of my experience coming from React, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. I'm currently learning Python as well. I've also been working as a Registered Nurse since 2014. I'm looking for work that would allow me to work in Mexico while my wife and I wait for her immigration to the United States to process. I love working with people and feel like I adapt quickly to new environments and roles.</div>
